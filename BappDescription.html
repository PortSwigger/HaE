<p>Highlighter and Extractor is an auxiliary framework project in the field of cybersecurity (data security), aimed at achieving highlighting and information extraction of HTTP messages (including WebSocket). This project customizes regular expression matching for response messages or request messages and marks and extracts messages that successfully.</p>

<p>Note: The use of HaE requires a basic regular expression foundation for testers. Since the Java regular expression library is not as elegant or convenient as Python, when using regular expressions, HaE requires users to use () to extract what they need The expression content contains; for example, if you want to match a response message of a Shiro application, the normal matching rule is rememberMe=delete, if you want to extract this content, you need to become (rememberMe=delete).</p> 

<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>The configuration file is initialized when HaE is loaded for the first time. The default configuration file has a built-in regular expression: Email. The initialized configuration file will be placed in the same directory as the BurpSuite Jar package.</p>
